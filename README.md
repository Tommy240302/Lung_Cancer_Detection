# Lung_Cancer_Detection
# �� Pneumonia Detection App via Chest X-ray and Symptoms

A deep learning-based application for early pneumonia screening from X-rays and symptoms.

### 🛠️ Technologies
- Python 3.8.20
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Tkinter
- PIL
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📌 Features

- 🖼 Load and analyze chest X-ray images (grayscale)
- 🧠 Deep learning prediction using a trained CNN model
- 📝 Input form for symptoms (e.g., cough, chest pain, smoking, etc.)
- 📊 Provides predictive result: low or high risk of lung cancer
- 🔄 Clean, simple, and intuitive graphical interface

### 📦 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tommy240302/Lung_Cancer_Detection
cd https://github.com/Tommy240302/Lung_Cancer_Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Run
```bash
python app.py
```

### 🧪 Dataset
- Kaggle Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/code/bonicajalakam/lung-cancer-detection-using-cnn/input
- Symptoms: Custom structured medically

### 📊 Results
- Accuracy: ~93%
- Precision/Recall: 99%
- Regularization: Dropout, Augmentation, Balanced Classes

### 📌 Future Work
- Database connection
- Detect more lung diseases
- Hospital software integration

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the GUI launches, you can:

- 📷 Load an X-ray image via **"Ảnh chụp X-Quang" (Load X-ray Image)**
- 🔍 Analyze the image via **"Phân tích ảnh" (Analyze Image)**
- 📝 Enter symptoms via **"Nhập triệu chứng" (Enter Symptoms)**
- ✅ Get a prediction on potential lung cancer risk
